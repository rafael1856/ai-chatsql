DOES NOT WORK BECAUSE gzip is not a valid file tar or zip file.
To modify the script to pull configuration data from a file named postgres_db.conf located in c:\webservices, you can use Python's built-in configparser module, which is designed for handling configuration files. This approach assumes that your postgres_db.conf file is in the INI file format, which is a common format for configuration files.

First, ensure your postgres_db.conf file is structured correctly. For example:

[database]
host = localhost
port = 5432
user = postgres
password = admin123
dbname = employees

Function read_config that reads the configuration file using configparser. It then returns the configuration data as a dictionary, which you can use to access the database connection details.

Please note, the password is printed in plain text for demonstration purposes. In a real-world scenario, you should handle sensitive information like passwords securely.
