   - **Role:** Initial setup to ensure the application has the necessary configuration to proceed.

2. **`check_conda_env()`**
   - **Purpose:** Checks if a conda environment is currently active.
   - **Parameters:** None.
   - **Returns:** `bool` - `True` if a conda environment is active, `False` otherwise.
   - **Role:** Ensures the application is running in the correct environment, which might be necessary for certain dependencies or configurations.

3. **`prepare_sidebar_data(database_schema_dict)`**
   - **Purpose:** Prepares data for visualizing the database schema objects in the Streamlit sidebar.
   - **Parameters:** `database_schema_dict` (dict) - A dictionary containing the database schema information.
   - **Returns:** `dict` - A dictionary representing the sidebar data, organized by schema and table names.
   - **Role:** Facilitates the user interface by providing a structured view of the database schema.

4. **`run_chat_sequence(messages, functions)`**
   - **Purpose:** Runs a chat sequence with the given messages and functions, interacting with the AI model.
   - **Parameters:** `messages` (list) - A list of messages exchanged in the chat sequence.
   - `functions` (dict) - A dictionary of available functions.
   - **Returns:** `dict` - The last message in the chat history.
   - **Role:** Handles the main logic of the chat interaction, including sending messages to the AI model and processing its responses.

5. **`clear_chat_history()`**
   - **Purpose:** Clears the chat history stored in the Streamlit session state.
   - **Parameters:** None.
   - **Returns:** None.
   - **Role:** Provides a way to reset the chat history, useful for starting a new conversation.

6. **`count_tokens(text)`**
   - **Purpose:** Counts the total tokens used in a text string, useful for managing API call limits.
   - **Parameters:** `text` (str) - The input text string.
   - **Returns:** `int` - The total number of tokens used in the text string.
   - **Role:** Helps manage the token usage for API calls, ensuring compliance with API limits.

7. **`save_conversation(conversation_history, directory="conversation_history")`**
   - **Purpose:** Saves a given conversation history to a markdown file with timestamps.
   - **Parameters:** `conversation_history` (list) - The conversation history to be saved.
   - `directory` (str, optional) - The directory where the conversation history will be saved. Defaults to "conversation_history".
   - **Returns:** `str` - The file path of the saved conversation history.
   - **Role:** Provides a way to persist and review past conversations.

8. **`send_api_request_to_openai_api(messages, functions=None, function_call=None, model=AI_MODEL, openai_api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY)`**
   - **Purpose:** Sends a request to the OpenAI API's chat completions endpoint, interacting with the AI model.
   - **Parameters:** `messages` (list) - A list of message objects containing 'role' and 'content' keys.
   - `functions` (list, optional) - A list of function objects. Defaults to None.
   - `function_call` (dict, optional) - A dictionary representing the function call. Defaults to None.
   - `model` (str, optional) - The model to use for the API request. Defaults to AI_MODEL.
   - `openai_api_key` (str, optional) - The API key for the OpenAI API. Defaults to OPENAI_API_KEY.
   - **Returns:** `requests.Response` - The response object from the API request.
   - **Role:** Acts as the bridge between the application and the AI model, facilitating the exchange of messages and function calls.

9. **`execute_function_call(message)`**
   - **Purpose:** Executes a function call provided by the OpenAI API's response, such as querying the database.
   - **Parameters:** `message` (dict) - The API response message containing the function call details.
   - **Returns:** `str` - The results of the function call.
   - **Role:** Handles the execution of specific actions based on the AI model's responses, such as database queries.

10. **`ask_postgres_database(postgres_connection, query)`**
    - **Purpose:** Interacts with the Postgres database to execute a given SQL query.
    - **Parameters:** `postgres_connection` (object) - The connection object to the Postgres database.
